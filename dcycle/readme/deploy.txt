deploy.sh usage
=====

Installation
-----

Please place the entire "dcycle" directory, which contains the deploy.sh script,
at the root of your project.

Call this script from within a CoreOS VM, which must contain Docker.

Usage
-----

./dcycle/deploy.sh

  When used without any arguments, prints this help.

-p 1234

  Deploys your project so that it is available on port 1234 of the host. If the port
  is already allocated you will get the error message

-e [dev|prod]

  if -e is not set or not set to a valid value, we will assume "dev".

  dev:  we will deploy a container for development. All persistent data, if any, will
        be stored on the container, and hence will disappear when the container is
        destroyed. Also, development tools will be added to the container.

  prod: we will deploy a container for production. All persistent data, if any, will
        be stored outside the container. You may be asked to specify more information
        about where to store this information if it applies to your container. No
        development tools will be added to your container, and security will be tighter.

-n

  if -n is not set or not set to a valid value, we will assume "normal".

  This string will be appended to the container for easier management; for example tests
  might append a specific name like 'test14822' so that they can easily delete those
  containers when tearing down the test.
